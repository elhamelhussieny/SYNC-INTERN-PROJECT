## First Project "Create a simple chatbot using python""

A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) program that creates conversational interaction between the chatbot and another user through voice commands or text chats. What Is a Chatbot? A chatbot is a computer program that simulates human conversation through voice commands or text chats or both. Chatbot, short for chatterbot, is an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that can be embedded and used through any major messaging application. How chatbots work? Historically, chatbots were text-based, and programmed to reply to a limited set of simple queries with answers that had been pre-written by the chatbot’s developers. They operated like an interactive FAQ, and while they worked well for those specific questions and answers on which they had been trained, they failed when presented with a complex question or one that hadn’t been predicted by the developers. Why are chatbots important? Organizations looking to increase sales or service productivity may adopt chatbots for time savings and efficiency, as artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can converse with users and answer recurring questions As consumers move away from traditional forms of communication, many experts expect chat-based communication methods to rise. Organizations increasingly use chatbot-based virtual assistants to handle simple tasks, allowing human agents to focus on other responsibilities.

## Second Project "Boston House Price Prediction using python"

This project is focusing on predicting the price of house in boston, given a set of features that describe the house. I had solved this problem using Linear Regression model, in the dataset each row is describing a town or suburb in boston city. I will improved this model next week using some advanced techniques.

## Third Project "Face Mask Detection using python"
What is Face Detection?

The goal of face detection is to determine if there are any faces in the image or video. If multiple faces are present, each face is enclosed by a bounding box and thus we know the location of the faces

Human faces are difficult to model as there are many variables that can change for example facial expression, orientation, lighting conditions, and partial occlusions such as sunglasses, scarfs, masks, etc. The result of the detection gives the face location parameters and it could be required in various forms, for instance, a rectangle covering the central part of the face, eye centers or landmarks including eyes, nose and mouth corners, eyebrows, nostrils, etc.

#-Face Detection Methods There are two main approaches for Face Detection:

1_Feature Base Approach 2_Image Base Approach

Face detection algorithm

One of the popular algorithms that use a feature-based approach is the Viola-Jones algorithm and here I am briefly going to discuss it. If you want to know about it in detail, I would suggest going through this article, Face Detection using Viola Jones Algorithm.

Viola-Jones algorithm is named after two computer vision researchers who proposed the method in 2001, Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features”. Despite being an outdated framework, Viola-Jones is quite powerful, and its application has proven to be exceptionally notable in real-time face detection. This algorithm is painfully slow to train but can detect faces in real-time with impressive speed.

Given an image(this algorithm works on grayscale images), the algorithm looks at many smaller subregions and tries to find a face by looking for specific features in each subregion. It needs to check many different positions and scales because an image can contain many faces of various sizes. Viola and Jones used Haar-like features to detect faces in this algorithm
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this tutorial we will develop a machine learning project , Given an input image, our face mask detection model should be able to detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not with a good amount of accuracy.

To successfully complete this project, there are three major parts we need to think about:

Part 1: Create a training dataset – We should be able to create a training dataset of face images with proper bounding boxes of human faces and annotations indicating whether the person is wearing a face mask or not.

Part 2: Train an image classification model – We should be able to create an image classification model like a Convolutional Neural Network for face mask detection. The accuracy of detection heavily relies on the type and quality of the model we will be building.

Part 3: Make predictions – We should be able to detect faces on images and make predictions on whether or not the person is wearing a face mask using our trained image classification model.

## Fourth Project "Sign Language Classification using python"

Sign language is manual communication commonly used by people who are deaf. Sign language is not universal; people who are deaf from different countries speak different sign languages. The gestures or symbols in sign language are organized in a linguistic way. Each individual gesture is called a sign.

We will classify the sign language symbols using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After successful training of the CNN model, the corresponding alphabet of a sign language symbol will be predicted.
